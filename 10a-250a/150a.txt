I took a trip to Hubei last winter. I lived in the mountain with my mother. The air was very fresh and it made me feel relaxed. The weather was nice. It was sunny and little windy every day.There was no rain and the wind blew my hair. The temperature was about 10Â° so I put on my coat .I tried many local food.For example,I ate many cured meat. The food was cheap and delicious. However, the house wasn't very great because many insects made me crazy. I also did some farm work. For example,I fed pigs and chickens. In the fields, I pulled radishes cabbages. It was an unforgettable trip.
