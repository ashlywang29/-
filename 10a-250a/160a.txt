I went to Changsha last holiday with my best friend.We have been there for five days,although it was Octoberï¼Œthe weather there was still hot. And we visited many famous place.For example,Yuelu academy,Shaoshan,Orange Island and so on.which are really beautiful and splendid.In all of these wonders,I like Orange Island best,because this is a great place to honor our great chairman Mao zedong,his statue is very imposing and made us impressive,the scenery there is also beautiful, and when we been there it was sunny and cloudless.We all like this fantastic trip.When we back our own school,w miss each other.As I look through photos we havetaken I was sad and want to have the next trip with them right now,however,we'll have to wait until the next vacation to see each other
