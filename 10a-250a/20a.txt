Last summer, my family and I had a wonderful vacation in Chongging, China. The city, located in the southwest of the country, is known for its hot and humid climate. However, we enjoyed exploring the beautiful landscape and delicious cuisine that Chongqing has to offer.
During our stay,the weather was mostly sunny and hot.The temperature often reached above 30 degrees Celsius during the day, while the nights were somewhat cooler.
One of the highlights of our trip was visiting theYangtzeRiver,.We took a boat ride on the river, enjoying the views of the city's skyline and the lush green hills surrounding it.
Another highlight was trying the local cuisine. Chongging is famous for its spicy hot pot, and we made sure to taste this delicacy. The hot pot broth was filled with chili peppers and other spices, and we cooked various meats,vegetables,and tofu in it.It was an unforgettable experience.
