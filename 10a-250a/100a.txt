I took a trip to London, England in the summer when I was nine years old with my parents.We stayed in a nice hotel. I can affirm that the hotel we reserved was grander than every hotel I had stayed ever. The weather here was comfortable.Because of the location, the temperature here wasn’t high in summer. It was very cloudy actually.However, what bothered us a lot was we were supposed to take umbrellas with us to prevent a sudden rain. It was rainy all year round and very windy by water. I’m not willing to retrospect the food we had tasted there because it was indeed terrible. I solely remembered the taste of chips and various fired foods.The most attractive resort in this city was BakerSt 221b, Sherlock Holmes Museum.Everything here was indescribably good.For example,The gun,the seat, even the cup was explicitly corresponding with the plot in the novel.My thrill was beyond words.It was definitely wonderful trip.
