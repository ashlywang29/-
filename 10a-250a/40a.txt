Last summer, I went to Qinghai, a beautiful province in northwestern China. （Qinghai Lake and the local food were amazing because the weather was sunny and pleasant during the day.） Walking by the lake, I was captivated by its calm beauty and the fresh air. Trying the local food and staying in Tibetan guesthouses at night, this trip brought me closer to nature and the local culture. I can't wait to go back and make more great memories.
