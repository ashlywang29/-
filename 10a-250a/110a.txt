I took a trip to Beijing last summer.This was the first time I traveled with my friend without my parents.After we arrived there,it was rainy outside.So we first went to eat hotpot which is a local special food of Beijing .It was terrific!Next,we went to the Palace Museum.All the buildings  there made me shocked.For example,Hall of Supreme Harmony was magnificent.How wonderful and amazing they are! After that,we went to the Universal Studios.Luckily,the weather was clear and bright that day.That was really a fantastic palce,and I had my best time during this trip.The dolls there were extremely cute and I bought one.Finally, we stayed in the hotel on the last day.Because these days made we really tiredThis trip was full of difficults for we two students.However,I will never forget this excellent memory.
