We took a trip to Gannan this summer vacation. It was freezingly cold there.we rushed to the restaurant at the moment we got there,becausewe are striving to death.The food there are quite different from the normal food,because the climate and altitude there are quite different from ours.and I believe that almost everyone cannot accept the distinctive food. Howeverï¼Œthe milk tea and the dish called beef with a coat on it are extremely delicious! And then we went to the Labuleng temple. It was warm and sunny at that time.The Buddha and the fresco are holy and different. we also got to flower lake and Sanger grassland as well.I maintain that it is a brilliant place to spend our leisure time because the sky is blue ,and there are countless rare species whichI have never seen them before. For example,the marmots,the pikas and the black-necked cranes .What impressed me most was the marmots.They are fat and adorable. And we can experience distinct cultures there.  what a brilliant trip it w as!
