Last summer I went to Qingdao, a famous tourist attraction. First of all, I walked in the city.It was rainy heavily at that that time. The surrounding buildings were so beautiful but unique, and the people living there were enthusiastic and friendly.For example, they will be enthusiastic about talking to us when they know we come from other places.Then I visited a park which was called Xiao MaiDao. The weather was suitable and warm, which is also one of the reasons why tourists love it the most. The environment was fresh with clean water,because of the enhancement of people's environmental awareness.Howeverï¼Œ the worst thing when I traveling was that the hotel was expensive but crowded . In a word, I enjoyed the atmosphere that I couldn't wait to start the next journey.
