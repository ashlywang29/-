My Trip
I went to Yangzhou this summer vacation.There is a pome in China “烟花三月下扬州”to describe the beauty of Yangzhou .  However , I arrived in July.Although the first day was rainy and wet, I enjoyed myself.I saw many beautiful scenes in Yangzhou. The city has special scenery of “jiangnan ”. I like the rivers and bridges. They were historical and meaningful. The second day was cloudy and I decided to hang out in a bustling pedestrian street.I can’t wait to taste the local food when I arrived because its food was famous .For example,The Yangzhou fried rice was amazing!And other food all beyond my expectations.They were really delicious!The most interesting thing for me was Yangzhou’s slow life.People there had slow rhythm. They made a peaceful life and they were enthusiastic hospitality.Due to their slow pace of life,there were few people on street after eight pm.I thought it’s very suitable for us to spare old time in Yangzhou.Our hotel was great and cheap.The device in our hotel was intelligent and the style was contemporary.Although the weather there most of was rainy,I enjoyed myself all the time!
