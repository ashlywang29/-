After the college entrance examination, I went to Wuhan with my friends. Wuhan is a great city, because the food there is very delicious. There are many special snacks In Wuhan. During the week in Wuhan, I（we） went to many places to see the beautiful scenery and eat delicious food. For example hot noodles with sesame paste. In the process of this traveling, my friendship with my friends (friend) became stronger. hot noodles with sesame paste. However ,we did not have enough time to somewhere.I will go to Wuhan for the second time.
