 When I was studying in primary school during school summer holiday. It was a sunny day when we arrived.The beautiful sand beach and sea water provided us a sense of paradise. （You could see birds and little marine life such as crab on the beach because the ecology was protected very well.）The park nearby our hotel offered us some different wonderful scenery of rian forest，（for example，we can see funny gibbonjumping between vines，）which also attracted our eyes .The goods and souvenirs are cheap and fine.（However,the weather of Malaysia was too hot and wet,It was either sunny or rainy,the conditions of its city is not as good as its scenery.）By the way,the cash of Malaysia touched funny,it's more similar to plastic but not paper or fabric.
