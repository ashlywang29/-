I took a trip to Xi'an last summer with my two friends. (When
we make this decision,I really want to fly to there right now.
However,we took 3 days o choose a hotel with 3 bed). We got up
late in he mornings.
(Because we all played games at
nights.) The whether was extrmely hot when we went to see the
兵马俑. And I had never see there were so many people, if you
jump,then you would never come back o he grana.However, when
I saw it,I was shocked,I thought everything is worth it. I
couldn't image how the king build this great project at that
years. In the last day,the weather was great so we wandered on
the street and tasted some delicacy.
(For example, we tried
the Xi'an Paomo) And we ended this trip in a sunny day.
