I took the trip to western Sichuan this summer vacation. We drove the car along the national highway 318. At lower altitudes, the weather is fine. When we drove higher, the weather is becoming unpredictable. For example, the weather was hot at the low attitude, but when we drove to the top of the mountain, it was snowy, we must wear down jackets. There are so many beautiful scenes along the road. However, what impressed me most was Scenic Spot of Daocheng Yading. The sky is so blue, the air is sweet, as the result of protection of the state. We climbed the snow mountain, when we climbed higher, the oxygen is less, so we had to use the oxygen bottle to deal with adverse reactions caused by hypoxia. The weather is changeable. It was overcast and a little bit rainy when we were at the foot of the mountain. However, it was sunny when we at the top of the mountain. As soon as we reached the lake on the top, which called niunai sea, all of the tiredness passed away, we fell in love with the beautiful scenic. The local food was delicious, but it was more expensive than ChengDu's.
