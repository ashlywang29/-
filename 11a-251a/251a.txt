During the summer holiday when I was 13, I was in the trip to Russia. After a short flight, we stood on the land of Russia. The first impression it gave me was cold. I could hardly stand the temperature even under my down coat. Hower, cold weather makes people there enthusiastic and warm-heated. When I saw the hot smile on Russian girls' pretty face, I no longer felt frozen. They also helped me a lot. I was lost in the rendered city. Without their help, I might never get back to my family. In the first day we went to some museums there such as Sea Museums and Chocolate Factory Museum. I was amazed by the unique exhibits. Some big and special fish, huge machine, and other awesome thing, they took my breath away. We also visited some parks and tried different Kinds of foods. Lenin Park was the one I love most. It was not big but containing strength. Staring at the majestic statue of lenin, I felt power poured into me from feet. It was sunny and I bathed in the sunshine. Although the trip was wonderful, there were some pities. The most head-scratching thing was that the sockets in Russia were different from ones in China, so it took us time to solve our electrical problems. Good time is always short. In the flight back, I remember everything during the trip. All in all, it was a perfect and unforgettable trip. I am often thinking about going back for another time.
