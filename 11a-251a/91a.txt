Last summer I went to a household tourist attraction the West Lake, which located in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The minute I caught sight the picturesque landscape, I was addicted by the spectacular view. It was sunny and a little windy, the sunlight warmly scattered on the ground and warmed our heart. The gentle wind by the lake touched my face, as if it was a mom whispering to her child. It occurred to me a poem written by Su, a famous poet in Song Dynasty, in which described the unique scenery of the West Lake. Being attracted by the sights, I tasted local food as well. So delicious were the dishes that I still remembered the wonderful flavors. For example, there were Dongpo Pork, Beggar's Chicken and other traditional dishes. Among varieties of dishes. What impressed me most was the vinegar fish, one of the most popular dishes in Hangzhou. Additionally, the residents here were so warm-hearted, with their kind help, I enjoyed a extremely convenient trip in Hangzhou. What a great trip!
