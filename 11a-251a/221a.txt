In this summer, I went to WeiFang with my family. It was a fine day! The wind was gentle and the sky was clear. The sun was shining just like a diamond! We ate a world of delicious seafood. However, for my weak body, I felt uncomfortable later. That was a pity! In the afternoon, we drove to the seaside. However, the wind started to become very strong by the water. And there weren't a lot of clouds in the sky. Fortunately, there weren't so many people. Meanwhile, we did a lot of interesting games! For example, we caught some cute and small crabs. And we didn't cost much because we were invited by my uncle's old classmate. All in all, the trip was terrific, full of laughter and songs!
