I went to the northeast of China three years ago. I was absorbed in this place. On the one hand, there are beautiful views and warmth person. In winter, everywhere is covered with white. Snow was blowing in Harbin. Harbin has a world of snow and ice, which are filled in ice sculptures. In the Spring Festival, the streets are busy and vitality. Because there are lots of outgoing and easygoing people, who are famous of their nice morality in China. On the other hand, there are kinds of delicious food. For example, Harbin sausage, Guo Bao Rou and Chinese sauerkraut. Besides, the foods are known of large abundance. I love it so much that I would like to go there again. However, it's so cold that I need to get ready before I go.
