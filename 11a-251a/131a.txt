This holiday I went to Xizang with my classmates. It took us a long time to get to Xizang by green train. On the train, we saw the uninhabited area of Kekexili, with a magnificent scenery. The sky outside the window is blue, with a few clouds floating around. However, the crowded environment on the train is a bit uncomfortable. Because the long journey had worsened the environment of the train. After arriving, we went to the Potala Palace and learned a lot about Xizangâ€™s history and culture. After that, we went to the base camp of Mount Everest. There were many high snow mountains. It was very cold there, but the sky is vast and blue. At night, we saw a beautiful starry sky. However, due to altitude, breathing becomes difficult, accompanied by headaches. The price of food is expensive, and it is not fresh. For example, It cost me 50 yuan to buy a meal without any green vegetables. Even so, the breathtaking scenery is something that I will never forget.
