I took a trip to Zhang Jia Jie national forest park this summer holiday. The weather those days are variable. On the first day, it was sunny, and we drove about a thousand kilometers under the sun, it was tired. We lived in a small hotel near the gate of the park, it is convenient but the condition was not very good. For example, the bed is too short and too hard that I can't sleep comfortably. The next day became overcast and there were thick clouds. However, we were all surprised by the breathtaking scenery in the park, the beautiful plants, the steep valley and rocks, the clear water and so on. The last day was terrible because it was rainy all the day, and a lot of people with umbrella crowded there, so taking pictures became extremely difficult. To be honest, it was tired and thirsty, but the scenery was really nice. All in all, it was an unforgettable experience.
