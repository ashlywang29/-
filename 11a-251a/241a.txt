The trip I would not forget is that the way of go to the university from my hometown to Shanghai, because the journey was unbearable. I thought it will be a good experience at first, however, the fact was not so. It's really a bad remember. During the trip, I even got mad. Much things had nothing idea to be done. For example, l had to keep in a small room with others I did not know about on the train. Which company with me is my phone. It never rains but it pours, the phone wasn't work as usual. At that time, it was rainy. l haven't done anything but lay down on the bed and ate the snack I don't like. l am so boring that I even look the sky, but it couldn't be blacker. So sad was Il. The next day's morning, the weather is sunny. When the train got Shanghai, I was so happy that I couldn't help exciting, not be I will have chance to play in Shanghai, just because l will leave away from the train. The air is so good from the Shanghai train station
