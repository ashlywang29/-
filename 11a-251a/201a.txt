We took a trip to Chongqing this holiday. The first things when we arrive in Chongqing is to start our task to find the hotel. The sunny weather made us comfortable, but the path is complex, which took us almost one hour to find a way to go to our hotel. We also visited a lot of scenery, for example, we visit the Liberation Monument, however, I don't find anything is really attracted to me. I also think it is a good trip in all, not only because the wet weather is suitable, but also because of the factor that attracted me most is the spicy and delicious food, which release my stress from the college entrance test. In conclusion, Chongging is not worth to travelling for two times, but everyone can enjoy themselves at the first time.
