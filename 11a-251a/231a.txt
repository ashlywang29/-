I made a travel to the Philippines a few years ago, where is known for its beautiful beaches, friendly people and unique culture. The warm sunny weather there always gave me a sense of wellbeing. I hope the weather will stay in this way. As soon as we got there, we had a big meal and the seafood there caught my taste buds. However, the price there is a little expensive. I'm curious why the labor is so cheap. The exciting activities made us enjoyable. For example, we went surfing on the blue sea, basked in the sun on the beach and so on. Then we relaxed in the hotel, because after a day of fun, we were already a bit tired. What made me surprised is that the waiter told me the spicy stick I gave to him tasted delicious. The next day, we chartered a luxury yacht to go out to sea. It's cleaning up and the mild wind just blew through our face and body. Playing on slides and diving leaves us with unforgettable memories. Although starfish are adorable, I was afraid of it. What made me most regretted was that I lost my lovely phone in that trip.
