We have taken a trip to HongKong. (On the first day when we arrived in it. We chose to shop as the first action because it was rainy outside.) We choose to shop not only the bad weather, but also that HongKong is a big city with enough shopping malls which means we can buy everything meaningful that we needed. Finally we bought a lot of souvenirs. (For example, we have bought a lot of cute toys and some bottles with strange appearance.) Then there is also a Disney Park so we paid a visit to it the next day. It was sunny that day which was a good weather. The wonderful and fascinating equipment inside have made us enjoyable. (However the huge and noisy crowd has made us mad). At the end of the day, we went back and we all thought that we have a good time there.
