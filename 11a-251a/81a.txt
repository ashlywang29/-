I went to Xiamen with my parents when I went to school at Grape Five. I still remembered I was so excited that I couldn't help to laughing because I heard this decision. It was a four-day trip. I liked fruit so much so that I ate lots of local fruits. For example, there were mango, mangosteen and durian. We lived in a hotel in the Gulangyu which was a beautiful island. The weather was so great. The first three days was sunny. The sky was azure blue. However, it rained on the last day. In the island, I saw a plenty of local people wearing local clothes. And there are some delicious food such as Shacha noodles. In a word, it was a great trip in my life.
