I took a trip to Xi'an last summer with my two friends. (When we make this decision, I really want to fly to there right now. However, we took 3 days to choose a hotel with 3 bed). We got up late in the mornings. (Because we all played games at nights.) The weather was extremely hot when we went to see the 兵马俑. And I had never seen there were so many people, if you jump, then you would never come back o he grana. However, when I saw it, I was shocked, I thought everything is worth it. I couldn't image how the king build this great project at that years. In the last day, the weather was great so we wandered on the street and tasted some delicacy. (For example, we tried the Xi'an Paomo) And we ended this trip in a sunny day.
